# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

No previous versions will be supported. This project is not meant to be self-hosted. Doing so means you assume any risks associated. Only the latest version will be supported for security updates, which will be pushed via new versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Reporting security issues should be done via email ideally. I can be reached at me@atridad.dev. Please include the repository you are reporting issues for, as well as any information regarding repro or related files (if you happen to know where the issue lies). I will work with you to identify the issues and patch them.
