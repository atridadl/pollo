# Sprint Padawan ![Status](https://status.atri.dad/api/badge/4/status?upColor=%23d10ace&downColor=%23ff0400&pendingColor=%23ff0400&style=for-the-badge)

A scrum poker tool that helps agile teams plan their sprints in real-time.

## Stack

- Front-end framework: Remix
- Front-end library: React
- Rendering method: SSR
- Hosting: Fly

## Versioning

- I use a bastardized version of semantic versioning. I jump to a new minor release whenever I feel like I made enough patch releases.
- All released are named using the corperate BS generator, found [here](https://www.atrixnet.com/bs-generator.html).

## Contributing

Feel free to propose changes via PR. I'm not awfully picky about formatting right now, so I'll accept/reject on a case-by-case basis. Please make sure to have an issue first though.
